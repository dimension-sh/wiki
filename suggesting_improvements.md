# Suggesting Improvements

If you have an idea of what can be improved, or something you need installing, then feel free to drop a email to the [sysops](mailto:sysops@dimension.sh).

We keep a roadmap of improvements we're working on open on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/dimension-sh/projects/1). All of our repositories are [open on GitHub](https://github.com/dimension-sh) so if you are so technically inclined we'd happily accept pull requests for improvements and fixes.
