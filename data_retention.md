# Data Retention

As part of operating a public system we need to retain some data to investigate any security issues or abuse. Our policy is to keep the minimum viable amount of data.

In terms of logging:

* System activity, including login records - 4 weeks
* Mail logs (not content) - 4 weeks
* Website access logs - 10 days
* Gemini / Gopher access logs - 10 days

For personal data uploaded to our systems, and held in the user's home directory, we have the following policies:

* Personal data on active systems - Removed at account termination.
* Off-site, Encrypted backups - Removed after 30 days from account termination.

## Your Data

Any data you store on the system is protected from loss by several redundant systems.

* Highly available storage offered by DigitalOcean
* Encrypted off-site backups created daily, rotated every month.

## Data Location

All data is stored within the United Kingdom, and as such, under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom and all applicable laws.
