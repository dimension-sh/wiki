### Our Servers

We have a few different servers to serve different needs, and the only truly 'net accessible ones are the shell servers; all other servers can only be connected to via the shell systems.

#### Shell Servers

Name | CPU | Memory | Disk | OS               | Connectivity | Location                   |

S1   | 1   | 2GB    | 25GB | CentOS 8         | IPv4 / IPv6  | DigitalOcean, London, UK   |
S2   | 1   | 2GB    | 16GB | Rocky Linux 8 RC | IPv6         | Doofnet.uk, Manchester, UK |

#### Build Servers

Want to package some RPMs or build a larger C project? These servers are the place to do it, away from the Shell and on much more resources.
