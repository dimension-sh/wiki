### Our Servers

We have a few different servers to serve different needs, and the only truly 'net accessible ones are the shell servers; all other servers can only be connected to via the shell systems.

#### Shell Servers

#### Build Servers

Want to package some RPMs or build a larger C project? These servers are the place to do it, away from the Shell and on much more resources.
