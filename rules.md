### Rules

We're not the type of people to heavily police everything that is going on, but we do have a few simple rules to follow:

* **Be Excellent To Each Other** - Be respectful to each other and the public.
* **Don't do anything that could risk the service** - No hacking, spam, torrents, or any other grey area actions.</li>
* **Be a good neighbour** - We all share the same system, so don't hog all the resources.

If any user is found in breach of the rules, then their account will be locked for a period of time, or deleted for repeat offenders. We're not dictators by any means and every incident will be reviewed, so you don't have to worry about losing your account due to an accident.
