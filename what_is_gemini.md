## What is Gemini?

Gemini is a new protocol, much like HTTP but with a few key goals:

* To be more powerful than Gopher.
* To be lighter than HTTP.
* Take user's privacy seriously.

The current Gemini space consists of about 1000 capsules, and is growing daily.

### Clients

Gemini has clients for almost all platforms. A full list can be found at [Awesome Gemini](https://github.com/kr1sp1n/awesome-gemini#clients), but here is a list of suggested clients:
